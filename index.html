  <h1>My pet.</h1>
  <img src="images/kasha.jpg" alt="Kasha's picture.">
  <p>Her name is Kasha. She is one year old. She has two kittens named;
   <ul>
     <li>Akasha</li>
     <li>Nakasha</li>
   </ul>
 Kasha is very friendly. When anyone comes into my home compound, she is the first to notice it and then she will lead him/her to the entrance of the house. Kasha together with her kittens wait for me outside the gate whenever am out to job or to buy something. </p>
 <p>Whenever am sitted in the house watching, she loves to climb on my shoulder or sit on my laps and then i will scratch under his neck(this makes his sleep).
   There sis a time that Kasha would run away and would be back after three days. After one month, I noticed she was pregnant and i also noticed a male cat who happened to be her "boyfriend" around the compound most of the times.
