      <h1>My pet.</h1>

      <img src="images/kasha.jpg" alt="Kasha's picture.">
      <p>Her name is <strong>Kasha</strong>. She is one year old. She has two kittens named;
        <ul>
          <li>Akasha</li>
          <li>Nakasha</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Kasha</h2>
        <p>Kasha is very a friendly cat(I fell in love with her first time i took her
          in my arms). When anyone comes into my home compound, she is
          the first to notice it and then she will lead him/her to the entrance of
          the house.Kasha together with her kittens wait for me outside the gate
          whenever am out to job or to buy something.</p>
        <p>She can be very <em>naughty</em>. There is a time that she ran away and came
          back after three days. After one month, I noticed she was pregnant and i
          also noticed a male cat who happened to be her "boyfriend" around the
          compound most of the times.</p>

        <p><strong>Kasha's Likes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever am sitted in the house watching, she loves to climb on my
            shoulder or sit on my laps and then i will scratch under his neck(this
            makes his sleep).</li>
          <li>Kasha loves cartoon movies(sound's weird right?). She really concentrates
            on those movies you would think she can understand their language.</li>
          <li>She loves to play with the throw pillows. I find my sitting room
            disorganised everyday(am used to tudying up my house everytime i come in.)
          <li>She loves to play with her kittens too,they run after each other around the house, sometimes we even run after each other(i love their game).
        </ul>
